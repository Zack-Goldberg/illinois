## Spring '20 Planning


There has been a lot of interest in THW at Illinois but we need to continue to provide the resources students want to help them excel!

Questions to think about:

- What **has** and **hasn't** worked?
- What topics should be covered?
- Is there interested in long-term learning?
- What kind of professional development would be helpful?
	- resume, cover letter, presentation templates
	- industry speakers
- THW Slack?

(I borrowed from [Spring '16 Planning post](Spring-16-Planning))
